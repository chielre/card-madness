# Card madness

_Description, version and other information coming soon_


## Disclaimer

This is an experimental project. I love writing code, but for this project the focus is on functionality and outcome rather than security or real-world usage. The goal is to create a fun game to play with friends, not to sell or host for a larger audience. Read the AI disclaimer to make your own assessment of how this project may be useful to you.

## AI Disclaimer
For this project (Card Madness), I use AI tools in a supportive role: Suno for music creation, Codex for code suggestions, and ChatGPT for productivity and inspiration. While these tools influence the overall product, all design decisions, UI/UX, implementation, and final responsibility remain entirely my own.
This project also serves as an experiment to explore how AI can support a developer in a controlled and safe environment.
